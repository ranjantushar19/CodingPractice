# 🧮 CodingPractice - Data Structures and Algorithms

This is my personal repository for practicing and improving my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Till now it focuses on:

- 🧠 **Dynamic Programming**
- ⚙️ **Greedy Algorithms**
- ➗ **Mathematics & Number Theory**

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen and Revise core problem-solving techniques.
- Build familiarity with common algorithmic patterns.
- Prepare for coding interviews and technical assessments.


Each file typically includes:
- A brief description of the problem (as a comment).
- A clean Python implementation.
- Time and space complexity (if applicable).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Tools**: PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook / Git

## 🚧 Ongoing Progress

This repository is a **work in progress** and will continue to grow as I solve more problems and explore new topics such as:

- Arrays & Strings
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- and more...

Stay tuned as this grows into a complete DSA library of personal practice! 🚀
